		I love you much that I don't know if I could finish this paragraph because words really can't explain my love towards you but I might be your future wife and you be my last boyfriend ever and I'm so happy that God brought me you. You're like my other half and without you I don't know where I'd be. You keep me on the right track and you're always there for me through thick or thin.ü•πüôåüèΩ You are my worldüåç and I never want to lose you. You'll never have to worry about me cheatingüòè or leaving you because you are the only one, my everythingüåçüíç‚ù§Ô∏è. Baby, thank you for loving me for who I am. Thank you for making me laugh and smile when I'm sad or having a bad day. I still get excited when I see your name pop up on my phoneüôà. You're always on my mind. You're all I want, all I need. You're my whole entire world. Babe, you know I love you and I tell you every day to remind you, but you'll never know how much I love you because my love for you can't be expressed in words. I know I'm not the best, but I'll always be here for you if you let me. How I wish that I could spend my whole life under the skies watching the stars with you? No amount of distance, pain, fights, or differences in opinion can break my bond with you. You're like my best of friends and the deepest of lovers. You are on my mind every second, every minute, every hour, every day, and every single time I blink. You fill all the space in my mind and heart. I love you, baby. I love you. I cannot find words to tell you how much I love you. You mean everything to me. Please stay by my side forever. I cannot possibly think of loving anyone else the way I love you. I cannot imagine my life without you. You mean so much to me. You filled my life with music, color, and laughter.I can't imagine a life without you or a life before you or a life after youüòìüíî. I will never ever be able to love anyone as much as I have loved you.
